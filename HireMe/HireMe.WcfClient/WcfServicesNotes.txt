I just added the app.config file as a link to the HireMe.Wpf (Gui App) project.

"When calling a WCF service from a class library project in Visual Studio 2010 
you can use the Add Service Reference feature to automatically generate a 
proxy and associated configuration file. The configuration file will not be 
used by the class library project. You will need to copy the configuration file 
to the directory that contains the executable that will call the class library."
